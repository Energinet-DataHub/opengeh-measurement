140000000000170201;2023-01-01 23:00:00;12.787;Limit is 32.787. Quantity for Jan. 1std is the same (20), so no new rows are added. But value for Jan. 2nd is now 12.787 (up to limit) which is different from previous value of 20.
140000000000170201;2023-01-02 23:00:00;0;Zero is now added to child, because limit has been hit in new period (was 20 before).
