# Test Overview

Below is a tabular overview mapping identified risks to corresponding product goals, with additional descriptive details and corresponding test approaches and levels.

| ID  | Product Goal    | Risk                                        | Description                                                                                                           | Test Approach                                                                                                  | Test Level(s)       |
|-----|-----------------|---------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|
| RPM2501 | PM 25 | The contract mutates and is not detected     | Changes in the protobuf-based data contract could occur without being recognized, potentially breaking integrations.  | Contract testing using data-driven tests (input/output via protobuf, compared with predefined output)          | ?   |
| RPM2502 | PM 25 | Schemas change                               | Evolving schema definitions risk causing mismatches and errors in data ingestion, processing, or storage.             | Unit tests to ensure correct schema structure, updated when schemas migrate                                   | ?          |
| RPM2503 | PM 25 | Validations do not validate what they should | Existing validation logic may fail to catch invalid data or incorrectly reject valid data, impacting data quality.     | Data-driven unit tests of validations (including negative scenarios where invalid data is quarantined)        | ?          |
| RPM2504 | PM 25 | Data quality varies from Bronze → Silver → Gold | Data passing through the data pipeline layers may vary in quality, risking incorrect transformations or data loss.      | Data-driven integration tests across all layers (Bronze → Silver → Gold) to ensure correct handling and transformation | ? |
| RPM2505 | PM 25 | The confirmation mutates and is not detected  | The confirmation message to the process manager could unintentionally change, risking communication or data integrity issues. | Contract testing using data-driven tests (input/output through the confirmation engine, compared with expected output) | ? |
